Project | [Paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.05916.pdf)

This is the official PyTorch implementation of "Video Waterdrop Removal via Spatio-Temporal Fusion in Driving Scenes". This works aims at removing various types of waterdrops for driving cars on rainy days. We also provide a large-scale synthetic dataset for the video waterdrop removal task.
